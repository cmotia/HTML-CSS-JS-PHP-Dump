				<h2> Introduce yourself </h2>
				<p> Hello my name is Christopher Motia I am from Pasadena California. 
				I am currently a student in the computer science program at Indiana University. While I
				am not actually that good at computer science at this point I'm in too deep and realize 
				that because I'm in the ROTC program I'll be pretty set up even if I am not the 
				best coder to walk to earth. Outside of that I've done stand up comedy once and am planning on 
				releasing an EP in the coming months, not anything special but hopefully something. So for
				a computer science guy I can confidently say I have at least a slimmer of personality.</p>
			
				<h2> A brief introduction of the homepage </h2>
				<p> This homepage is designed to facilitate my learning within the i101 class. I don't
				have a complete idea of what I want to learn from this experience but hopefully I learn
				how to actually implement code considering I got through c211 knowing no more about the
				application of computer science than what I went into it with. </p>
				
				<h2> Whats at the top of your college bucket list and why </h2>
				<p> <u><b><i>Ideally</i></b></u> I'd like to graduate but we'll see. Outside of that my bucket list consists
					mainly of getting involved with outdoor oriented clubs at IU. This is mainly because
					I was an overweight kid and was not able to participate in those kind of activies
					as a kid so I'm trying to make up for lost time. On top of that I'd like to create
					a practical application before leaving college but ive yet to have an idea for what 
					to make.</p>
